Friends of Courtenay is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization made up of parents, caregivers, alumni, and community members who support the mission and vision of [Mary E. Courtenay Language Arts Center](https://courtenay.cps.edu/). 

Our focus is on fundraising to support the school, making sure every young person in Uptown has access to a joyful learning experience.

Courtenay Language Arts Center is a welcoming neighborhood school that centers joyful, rigorous learning and strong relationships between students, staff, and families. The school serves students with a wide range of abilities and is dedicated to meeting learners where they are, while challenging them to grow.

Students develop strong reading, writing, speaking, and critical-thinking skills through a language-arts–rich curriculum. Courtenay partners closely with families and the wider community to create a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment where every child is known and encouraged.
