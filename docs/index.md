Beyond the typical funding shortfalls faced by public schools, **81.6% of Courtenay students are economically disadvantaged.[^1]** 

*Friends of Courtenay* is a non-profit organization ( application pending for 501c3 ) made up of parents, caregivers, alumni (including Stockton alums!), and community members who donate in support of the academic mission and vision of [Mary E. Courtenay Language Arts Center](https://courtenay.cps.edu/), so every young neighbor has a joyful learning experience.

## Supporting Our Neighbors

![Aldi Gift Cards](ALDIgiftcards.jpeg){ align=right width="200" }

When SNAP benefits were frozen, neighbors rallied for Courtenay families. We distributed **$1,245 in Aldi gift cards** on Nov. 15, and are distributing another **$1,000 in food aid** this week.

With 93% of our students from low-income families and 21% housing insecure, your help is critical.[^2] We aim to raise another **$1,000 before Winter Break**.
