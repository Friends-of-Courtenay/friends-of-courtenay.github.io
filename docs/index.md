# Welcome, Friends of Courtenay! { .center-title .courtenay-headline }
<div align="center" markdown>

</div>

[Mary E. Courtenay Language Arts Center](https://courtenay.cps.edu/) in Uptown offers pre-K through 8th education. If you've been in or around Courtenay recently, you've seen the abundant community support. Yet like many neighborhood schools, Courtenay is under-resourced. Friends of Courtenay aims to fund programs and materials to help teachers and staff to invest in the rich potential and exuberance in every child.

*Friends of Courtenay* is a nonprofit organization made up of caregivers, alumni, community members, and local partners who invest in the school's academic [mission and vision](https://courtenay.cps.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=412940&type=d), so every young neighbor in Uptown has a joyful learning experience.

## Food Security for Courtenay Students

When SNAP benefits were frozen, neighbors rallied for Courtenay families. We distributed **$1,245 in Aldi gift cards** on Nov. 15, and are distributing another **$1,000 in food aid** this week.

With 93% of our students from low-income families and 21% housing insecure, your help is critical.[^1] We aim to raise another **$1,000 before Winter Break**.
