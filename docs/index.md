# Welcome to Friends of Courtenay { .center-title }

The talented pre-K through 8th grade students who attend Uptown's [Mary E. Courtenay Language Arts Center](https://courtenay.cps.edu/) eagerly rise to challenges presented by their teachers and coaches. In 2025/26 they've earned multiple city-wide honors for academics, character, and a [regional championship](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHHI4oEyIU0/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) by the co-ed cheer team. But they're also challenged by a lack of resources, and that's where we want to help.

Beyond the typical funding shortfalls faced by public schools, **81.6% of Courtenay students are economically disadvantaged.[^1]** We want these students to know their friends and neighbors are proud of them, the same way nearby communities show pride for the young people at [Uplift](https://www.friendsofuplift.org/), [McCutcheon](https://friendsofmccutcheon.weebly.com/), and [Ravenswood](https://www.friendsofravenswoodschool.org/).

You can show your pride through *Friends of Courtenay*, a non-profit organization ( application pending for 501c3 ) made up of parents, caregivers, alumni (including Stockton alums!), and community members who donate in support of the academic mission and vision of [Mary E. Courtenay Language Arts Center](https://courtenay.cps.edu/), so every young neighbor has a joyful learning experience.

## Supporting Our Neighbors

![Aldi Gift Cards](ALDIgiftcards.jpeg){ align=right width="200" }

When SNAP benefits were frozen, neighbors rallied for Courtenay families. We distributed **$1,245 in Aldi gift cards** on Nov. 15, and are distributing another **$1,000 in food aid** this week.

With 93% of our students from low-income families and 21% housing insecure, your help is critical.[^2] We aim to raise another **$1,000 before Winter Break**.
