# Welcome, Friends of Courtenay! { .center-title .courtenay-headline }

[Mary E. Courtenay Language Arts Center](https://courtenay.cps.edu/) in Uptown is a pre-K through 8th grade public school where talented educators welcome students of all abilities. Yet sustained cuts to school and social-services are shutting out opportunities for children. With 93% of students from low-income backgrounds and 21% also experiencing housing insecurity, Courtenay families simply cannot raise money among themselves as is done in many neighboring schools.[^1]

*Friends of Courtenay* is a nonprofit organization made up of caregivers, alumni, community members, and local partners who invest in the school's academic [mission and vision](https://courtenay.cps.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=412940&type=d), so every young neighbor in Uptown has a joyful learning experience.

## Food Security for Courtenay Students

![Aldi Gift Cards](ALDIgiftcards.jpeg){ align=right width="200" }

When SNAP benefits were frozen, neighbors rallied for Courtenay families. We distributed **$1,245 in Aldi gift cards** on Nov. 15, and are distributing another **$1,000 in food aid** this week.

With 93% of our students from low-income families and 21% housing insecure, your help is critical.[^1] We aim to raise another **$1,000 before Winter Break**.
