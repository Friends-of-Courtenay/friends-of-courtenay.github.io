[Mary E. Courtenay Language Arts Center](https://courtenay.cps.edu/) in Uptown offers pre-K through 8th education. If you've been in or around Courtenay recently, you've seen the abundant community support. Yet like many neighborhood schools, Courtenay is under-resourced. Friends of Courtenay aims to fund programs and materials to help teachers and staff to invest in the rich potential and exuberance in every child.

*Friends of Courtenay* is a nonprofit organization made up of caregivers, alumni, community members, and local partners who invest in the school's academic [mission and vision](https://courtenay.cps.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=412940&type=d), so every young neighbor in Uptown has a joyful learning experience.
