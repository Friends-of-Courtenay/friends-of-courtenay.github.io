# Welcome, Friends of Courtenay! { .center-title .courtenay-headline }

[Mary E. Courtenay Language Arts Center](https://courtenay.cps.edu/) is open to all of Uptown's pre-K to 8th grade students and staffed by talented educators, yet funding cuts for both the school and social services are shutting out opportunities for children to thrive. With 93% of students from low-income families, 21% in temporary housing, and funding cuts to the school causing a lack of basic supplies, the need is immediate.[^1]

*Friends of Courtenay* is a non-profit organization (application pending for 501c3) made up of parents, caregivers, alumni (including Stockton alums!), and community members who donate in support of the academic mission and vision of [Mary E. Courtenay Language Arts Center](https://courtenay.cps.edu/), so every young neighbor has a joyful learning experience.

## Food Security for Courtenay Students

![Aldi Gift Cards](ALDIgiftcards.jpeg){ align=right width="200" }

When SNAP benefits were frozen, neighbors rallied for Courtenay families. We distributed **$1,245 in Aldi gift cards** on Nov. 15, and are distributing another **$1,000 in food aid** this week.

With 93% of our students from low-income families and 21% housing insecure, your help is critical.[^1] We aim to raise another **$1,000 before Winter Break**.
