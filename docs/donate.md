# Donate to Friends of Courtenay

Friends of Courtenay is a non-profit organization that supports students, families, and staff at Mary E. Courtenay Language Arts Center. Your gift helps fund classroom resources, field trips, family events, and other experiences that public funding alone can’t cover.

All donations support Friends of Courtenay and may be tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law. Please consult your tax advisor for details.

## Employee match

Many employers offer matching gift programs that can double (or even triple) the impact of your donation to Friends of Courtenay.

We have partnered with platforms such as **DonationXchange** and **Benevity** to accept matching gifts from participating employers. If you’ve given or are planning to give, contact your HR department to see what is possible. These platforms allow employees to submit charitable gifts directly through the system via credit card, e-check, or payroll deduction.
