# About Friends of Courtenay

Friends of Courtenay is a non-profit organization made up of parents, caregivers, alumni, and community members who support the mission and vision of [Mary E. Courtenay Language Arts Center](https://courtenay.cps.edu/).

We focus on fundraising and community-building so that the school can provide joyful, enriching learning experiences for Uptown’s young tigers. Our work helps fill gaps that public funding alone can’t cover – from classroom resources and field trips to family events and teacher appreciation.

## A history of community support

Courtenay families and neighbors have a strong track record of coming together to support the school. One example is [A Play Space For All](https://www.aplayspaceforall.com/), a community-based initiative to turn the old blacktop at Courtenay Language Arts Center into a space where every child can play.

We see this project as evidence of the long-standing demand and energy in the community to support Courtenay students.
