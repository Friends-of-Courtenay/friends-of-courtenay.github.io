# About Friends of Courtenay

Friends of Courtenay is a non-profit organization (501c3 pending) made up of parents, caregivers, alumni, and community members who support the mission and vision of [Mary E. Courtenay Language Arts Center](https://courtenay.cps.edu/).

## How do we spend donations?

Friends of Courtenay is entirely volunteer-run, there is no paid staff or overhead.

Right now we're raising money for immediate *Equity & Essentials* such as grocery gift cards to cover SNAP shortages, but once we have 501c3 status and funding on-par with other local CPS schools, we will consult with the [local school council](https://www.courtenay.cps.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=412981&type=d) to identify needs and opportunities for support that align with Courtenay's [mission and vision](https://courtenay.cps.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=412940&type=d).

## Our Vision

After gaining 501c3 status, here's an example of where we'll focus donations:

## A history of community support

Courtenay families and neighbors have a strong track record of coming together to support the school. The most recent example is [A Play Space For All](https://www.aplayspaceforall.com/), where the old blacktop was transformed into a space where every child can play, regardless of physical ability.

We see this project's success as evidence of the long-standing demand and energy in the community to support the school's vision of an inclusive learning environment.
